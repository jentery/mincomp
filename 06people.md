**Alex Christie** is a doctoral candidate in English at the University of Victoria. He conducts research on 3D geospatial expression and scholarly communication for the Modernist Versions Project (MVP) and Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE) in the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL). He is developing an open source toolkit for digital humanities pedagogy with grant funding from the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH); his dissertation traces experiments in procedural literary expression across modernist poems and manuscripts.

**Gabriel Egan** is Professor of Shakespeare Studies and Director of the Centre for Textual Studies at De Montfort University in England. He is co-editor with Gary Taylor of the Authorship Companion to the New Oxford Shakespeare to be published in April 2016. In the course of evaluating recent scholarship in authorship attribution by computational stylistics, Egan has become interested in how literary students can be introduced to algorithmic thinking and helped to understand the means by which machines store and manipulate texts. For this pedagogy, minimalism is desirable.
